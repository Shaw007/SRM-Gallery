# SRM-Gallery

A sample gallery app developed by me in my spare time. This app fetches a list of all the images a user has on his device and show them with their album names. When user taps on an album he can see all the images of the album and also can select them on long press. Photo detail screen has the full sized images and user can zoom it too.

This app user Android Jetpack Libraries. Some of them are:

- Navigation Component
- ViewModel and LiveData
- ViewBinding 
- Hilt for dependency injection
